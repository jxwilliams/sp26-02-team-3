This is to be intended to be able to use in emergency situations as well, with access to speak with professionals.  It is important for our customers to be able to access this information at any time they may need it. The goal of the app is to proivde care to all pets on and  around our campus, and allow pet owners to  connect with others who may be  facing the same problems. 



## app functions, customer and provider
## The customer will be able to select a region, and view availbale offices in that region. The offices will display their hours and available doctors. Some vets will have the option to offer emergency contact and care. IN order for our users to create a profile, our app will ask for pet descriptions and loactions, as well as the users phone number for verification. To view services, it will require input from our providers, the veternarian offices around town. In order to make an appointment or speak with that office with a contact, our app will need to open the individual webpages for that office. 

## Customer: create and modify profile, contact offices, contact other users, make an appointment

## The provider will be able to create their own webpage on our app. They can include their contact information, office locations, available doctors, and any other information they would like to include. 

## Provider: create and modify a webpage, update information, contact customers, accept appointments.
